# cleans and edits shoals data output, formats into same format used by access
# data entry templates so that shoals data can be imported into access
# Also useful for getting shoals data into a format that can be merged/joined
# onto big boy downloads, if shoals data from recent trip is not yet in big boy

# Author: Jan Boyer, AGFD jboyer@azgfd.gov
# inputs: .txt file (tab delimited) of fish data output from shoals program
#         using Files -> Export Data in shoals
# outputs: 2 .csv files:
#   one with site(sample) data: to import to FISH_T_SAMPLE table in access data
#                               entry template
#   one with fish(specimen) data: to import to FISH_T_SPECIMEN table in access
#                                 data entry template

# Note:Originally written for AGFD data, may need minor edits (i.e., add columns
# that your project uses but AGFD projects don't, some projects record PIT and
# finclip in RECAP_YES_NO, others only record PIT recap info) to work for other
# agencies or projects

#    2d. choose delimited on the second screen
#    2e. choose comma when asked what delimiter separates your data, and check

# 3. Repeat step 2 with specimen data, appending your specimen file to the
#    FISH_T_SPECIMEN table
